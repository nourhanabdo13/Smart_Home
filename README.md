Smart Home Project using pic18f4620
Smart Home System designed using the PIC18F4620 microcontroller on Proteus. This project integrates various smart systems aimed at enhancing home security, comfort, and efficiency. Here are the key features:

Door Locking with Password: This system uses a keypad to input a password and a pushbutton for confirmation. The status is displayed on an LCD, and a motor simulates the door movement. A green LED lights up if the password is correct, while a red LED and a buzzer are activated if it's incorrect.

Elevator Control: A keypad is used to select the desired floor, and a seven-segment display shows the current floor. A motor represents the elevator's movement, and a red LED indicates when the elevator is in motion.

Fire Detection System: Utilizing a flame sensor, this system detects fire. If a fire is detected, a red LED lights up, and a buzzer sounds an alert.

Gas Leak Detection: The MQ-2 gas sensor is employed to detect any gas leakage. If a leak is detected, a red LED illuminates as a warning.

Temperature-Controlled Ventilation: If the temperature exceeds 25Â°C, the system activates a fan, simulated by a motor, to ventilate the area.

Light-Controlled Curtains: Using an LDR, this system controls curtains represented by a motor. When light levels increase, the curtains open and the LED turns off; when light levels decrease, the curtains close and the LED turns on.

PWM Light Control: This feature allows for adjusting light intensity using a variable resistor and PWM control.

Pushbutton Light Control: Simple on/off control of lighting using a pushbutton.
